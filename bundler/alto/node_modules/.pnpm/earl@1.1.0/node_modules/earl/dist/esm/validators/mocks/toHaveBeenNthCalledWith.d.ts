         * Asserts that when the mock function was called the nth time it was called
         * with the given arguments. If the function was called less than n times
         * this will fail.
         *
         * The arguments are checked for deep equality and can also be matchers.
         *
         * If you would like to always check the last call use
         * `expect(fn).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(...)` instead.
         *
         * @param n - The call number to check the arguments of. Index starts at 1.
         * @param args - The arguments the mock function was expected to be called
         *   with the nth time. They can also be matchers.
         *
         * @example
         * ```ts
         * import { expect, mockFn } from 'earl'
         *
         * const fn = mockFn((a: string, b: string) => a + ' ' + b)
         * fn('i like', 'pancakes')
         * fn('you like', 'waffles')
         *
         * expect(fn).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(1, 'i like', expect.a(String))
         * expect(fn).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(2, 'you like', 'waffles')
         * expect(fn).not.toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(2, 'you like', 'pancakes')
